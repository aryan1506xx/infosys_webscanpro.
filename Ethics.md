WebScanPro — Legal & Ethical Guidelines

Core rule: Only scan targets you own or have explicit written authorization to test.

Before any active testing:

Obtain written permission (email or signed document).
Agree on scope: allowed IPs/URLs and test window.
Have contact and rollback plan for target owner.
Tool-enforced rules:

Default mode: passive-only checks.
Active scanning (e.g., OWASP ZAP) requires explicit user consent in the UI and confirmation of written permission.
Forbidden:

Scanning without authorization.
Sharing sensitive data captured from a target.
Using WebScanPro for offensive or criminal purposes.
Recommended practice:

Use local test apps such as OWASP Juice Shop, DVWA, or WebGoat when learning.
